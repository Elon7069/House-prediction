Here’s a polished and well-structured **README.md** for your Kaggle House Prices Prediction project 👇


# 🏠 House Prices Prediction (Kaggle)

This project aims to predict **house prices** based on various features using the [Kaggle House Prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishitaverma02/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques?select=train+%281%29.csv).
The goal is to build and evaluate different **regression models** to determine the best approach for accurate price prediction, while also identifying the most important features that influence housing values.

## 📊 Dataset

* **Source**: Kaggle ([House Prices – Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishitaverma02/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques?select=train+%281%29.csv))
* **Description**: Residential homes in Ames, Iowa, with **1460 rows** and **246 columns**.
* **Features**:

  * A mix of **numerical** and **categorical** variables describing physical aspects, quality, and environment of houses.
  * **Target Variable**: `SalePrice` – the final price of the house.

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing

1. **Handling Missing Values**

   * Numerical features → filled with **mean**
   * Categorical features → filled with **mode**

2. **Encoding Categorical Features**

   * Applied **One-Hot Encoding** (`pandas.get_dummies()`)
   * Dropped the first category to avoid multicollinearity

## 🤖 Models Used

The following regression models were trained and evaluated:

* **Linear Regression**
  Simple baseline model assuming linear relationships.

* **Random Forest Regressor**
  Ensemble of decision trees, reducing overfitting.

* **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
  Sequential tree-based model correcting errors from previous trees.

* **XGBoost Regressor**
  Optimized gradient boosting with high efficiency and speed.

## 📈 Results

| Model                   |         RMSE |   R² Score |
| ----------------------- | -----------: | ---------: |
| Linear Regression       |     51396.88 |     0.6556 |
| Random Forest Regressor |     28738.27 |     0.8923 |
| Gradient Boosting       |     27673.46 |     0.9002 |
| **XGBoost Regressor**   | **26532.15** | **0.9082** |

✅ **Best Model:** **XGBoost** → Lowest RMSE & highest R² score

## 🔑 Feature Importance (Top 10)

From **Random Forest** feature importance analysis:

1. `OverallQual` – Overall quality
2. `GrLivArea` – Above ground living area (sq ft)
3. `TotalBsmtSF` – Total basement area (sq ft)
4. `2ndFlrSF` – Second floor area
5. `1stFlrSF` – First floor area
6. `BsmtFinSF1` – Finished basement area
7. `LotArea` – Lot size (sq ft)
8. `GarageArea` – Garage size (sq ft)
9. `GarageCars` – Garage capacity (cars)
10. `YearBuilt` – Year of construction

These features strongly align with intuitive housing value factors: **size, quality, and age**.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Open Notebook

* Use **Google Colab**, **Jupyter Notebook**, or **JupyterLab**
* Recommended: Google Colab (pre-installed dependencies)

### 2. Upload Dataset

* Download dataset from Kaggle: [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishitaverma02/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques?select=train+%281%29.csv)
* Upload `train.csv` to your environment

### 3. Run Code

Execute all cells sequentially:

* Load dataset
* Preprocess data
* Train models
* Evaluate RMSE & R²
* Plot feature importance

## 📌 Key Takeaways

* **XGBoost** outperformed other models for predicting house prices.
* Key influential features: **quality, living area, basement size, and year built**.
* Ensemble methods significantly outperform simple linear regression in handling complex real-world data.
